  <h1><small>1.4</small> Cache Matters</h1>
  <div class="divider2"></div>
  <p>
    The system spends a lot of time moving information from one place to another
    (fetching data from disk, to main memory, to register file, to CPU and repeat).
    Because of this, a major goal for system designers should be to make these
    operations as fast as possible.

  <span class="note">Takeaway Concept</span>
  <blockquote>
    Because of <em>physical laws</em>, larger storage devices are slower than smaller ones.
    Reading from a register is much faster than reading from the main memory, but the
    register file is much smaller in size compared to the main memory.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Solution?</h3>
  <p>
    The CPU operates at a much higher speed than the main memory, and because of that,
    system designers include much faster but smaller storage devices called
    <strong>Cache Memories</strong> that serve as temporary staging areas for information
    that the processor is likely to need in the near future.

  <p>
    Cache memory exists in different layers: an L1 cache is the smallest but fastest,
    larger L2 cache is slower and so on. Cache is implemented with a hardware technology
    known as <strong>Static Random Access Memory</strong> (SRAM) discussed earlier.
