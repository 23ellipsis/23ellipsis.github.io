  <h1><small>1.2</small> Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms</h1>

  <div class="divider2"></div>
  <p>Consider this source code of a <code>hello</code> C program which prints Hello world on the screen:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
	printf("Hello world\n");
	return 0;
}
</code></pre>

  <ul>
    <li>This program begins life as a high-level C program that can be read and understood by humans as discussed
      earlier.</li>
    <li>These individual C statements must be translated by other programs (compilers) into a sequence of low-level
      <strong>machine-language</strong> instructions.</li>
    <li>These instructions are then packaged in a form called an <strong>executable object program</strong> (object
      programs are also referred to as <strong>executable object files</strong>)</li>
    <li>On a Unix system, the translation from source files to object files is performed by a <strong>compiler
        driver</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following command invokes the gcc compiler which is the native compiler for C programs in Unix systems</p>

  <pre><code>gcc -o hello hello.c
</code></pre>

  <h4>The Stages of Compilation</h4>

  <img src="images/1.2.png" width="800" alt="Stages of Compilation" />

  <ol>
    <li><strong>The Pre-Processor</strong> handles certain directive and instructions before the code is compiled. For
      example, whenever an <code>#include</code> statement is encountered, the pre-processor replaces it with the
      content of the file included.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>The Compiler</strong> checks for errors and translates the high level code into assembly instructions.
      Note that this step is the most significant as the high level statements get "translated" into assembly
      instructions, and depending on the <em>optimization level</em>, the assembly produced might not correspond to the
      high level code as expected (but still carry out the same task of course). At this stage, the resulting file is
      still a <em>text file</em> which contains assembly instructions.
      The command <code>gcc -S hello.c</code> will output a <code>hello.s</code> file which contains the assembly
      instructions without proceeding to invoke the assembler.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>The Assembler</strong> turns assembly instructions into machine code. This is <em>mostly</em> a
      one-to-one mapping between assembly instructions understood by humans (like <code>mov eax ebx</code>) to binary
      instructions understood by the CPU (like <code>0x89 0xD8</code> which are <code>10001001 11011000</code>).</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>The Linker</strong> combines functions and libraries, for example it resolves functions called in one
      file but defined in another</li>
  </ol>

  <span class="note">Takeaway Concept</span>
  <blockquote>

    Note that before assembly code is turned into an object file, it is still a text file. For example, if you open
    <code>hello.s</code> with a text editor, you’d see assembly instructions. But once the assembler takes this
    <code>hello.s</code> file and turns it into a <code>hello.o</code> file, it is no longer a text file and its bytes
    do not represent ASCII characters anymore. Now it’s an object executable file containing binary instructions the CPU
    can understand.
