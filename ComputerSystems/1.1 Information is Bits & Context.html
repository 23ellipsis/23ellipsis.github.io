  <h3>Consider the following source code of a program called <code>hello</code>:</h3>

  <pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){
    printf("Hello world\n");
}
  </code></pre>

  <p>
    Our <code>hello</code> program begins life as a <strong>source program</strong> (source file)
    that the programmer creates with an editor and saves in a text file called <code>hello.c</code>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>This source file is stored as a sequence of bits, organized in 8-bit chunks called <strong>bytes</strong>.</li>
    <li>Most modern systems represent characters using the ASCII standard which encodes each ASCII character using one
      byte.</li>
    <li>For example, the first byte has the value 35 which corresponds to the character <code>#</code> (in bits it would
      be <code>00100011</code>).</li>
    <li>
      After the source file gets <strong>compiled</strong>, an <strong>object file</strong> is generated
      which contains the low-level instructions that the CPU can understand and execute in order to carry out
      the task that was represented using the high-level C code.
      (this will be discussed in much more detail later on)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's important to emphasize that all data in a computer is stored as bits. The only thing that
    distinguishes different data objects is the context in which we view them. So, in different contexts,
    the same sequence of bytes might represent an integer, floating-point number, character string,
    or machine instruction.

  <span class="note">Takeaway Concept</span>
  <blockquote>

    Files such as <code>hello.c</code> that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as
    <strong>text files</strong>. All other files are known as <strong>binary files</strong>.<br><br>
    The idea is simple: a text file contains bytes that are translated to something humans can understand
    and view using a text editor (for example ASCII characters) while binary files contain bytes that are
    translated to something the computer understands (for example instructions represented in binary).<br><br>
    Try compiling a <code>.c</code> program then opening the resulting object file using a text editor.
    You'll notice that all you see is gibberish and that's because the object file does not contain many
    bytes that could be "translated" into characters using a text editor.
