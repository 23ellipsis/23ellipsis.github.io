  <h3>Representing Strings</h3>
  <p>
    Consider the following C code:
  </p>
  <br>
  <img src="images/2.3.1.png" width="600" alt="C Code String Representation" />
  <br>
  <p>
    This code creates a string with the value <code>"12345"</code>, and then prints
    the bytes stored in the memory address that is storing this string.
    Notice how the value of <code>"12345"</code> is actually stored in memory as
    <code>31 32 33 34 35 00</code>. These are the corresponding ASCII encodings for
    each character (for example, the string <code>"1"</code> corresponds to <code>"31"</code>
    in ASCII). Also, notice the <code>00</code> at the end, which is the null terminator
    marking the end of the string.
  </p>
  <p>
    This illustrates the difference between how strings and integers are handled in memory.
    If we were to store the integer <code>1</code> instead of the <em>string</em> <code>"1"</code>
    (denoted by the quotes), it would be stored in memory as <code>0x01</code>, not <code>0x31</code>.

  <h3>Representing Code</h3>
  <img src="images/2.3.3.png" width="600" alt="Binary Code Representation" />
  <p>
    As we know, programs are compiled into binary code that is executed by the CPU.
    Compilers generate this binary code based on different factors such as CPU architecture
    and operating system conventions, which is why it can differ across systems.
