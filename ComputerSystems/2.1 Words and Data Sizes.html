    <p>
        Rather than accessing individual bits in memory, most computers use blocks of eight bits (one byte) as the
        smallest addressable unit of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        A machine-level program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as <strong>virtual
            memory</strong>.
        Each byte of memory is identified by a unique number, known as its <strong>address</strong>,
        and the set of all possible addresses is known as the <strong>virtual address space</strong>.

    <h3>Hexadecimal Notation</h3>
    <p>
        Hex uses numbers from 0-9 and characters from A-F to represent 16 possible values.
        Two digits in hex can represent 255 unique values, the same amount eight digits in binary can represent.
        <code>0xFF</code> = <code>11111111</code> because <code>16^2</code> = <code>2^8</code>
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        Remember:
        whatever value that starts with <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> is a value represented in hex.
        Hex is case-insensitive, so <code>0x49f</code> = <code>0x49F</code>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Words</h4>
    <p>
        Every computer has a <strong>word size</strong>, which indicates its <strong>pointer size</strong> (memory
        address size).
        It also refers to the amount of data the CPU stores in one register.
        In 32 bit systems, the word size is 32 bits. This means multiple things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are <code>2^32</code> possible memory addresses (around 4 billion).</li>
        <li>The addresses would be represented using 32 bits (duh) and would range from <code>0x00000000</code> to
            <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code>.</li>
        <li>Each register would have the size of 32 bits.</li>
    </ul>

    <span class="note">Binary to Hex conversion</span>
    <blockquote>
        <code>8</code> bits can represent <code>256</code> different values (each digit can represent one of two
        possible values and we have 8 digits, so <code>2^8</code>)<br>
        These <code>256</code> unique values can be represented using two hex digits
        (because each digit can represent one of sixteen possible values and we have two digits, so <code>16^2</code>
        which is <code>256</code>.)<br>
        Thus, each byte could be represented using two hex digits. The range would be <code>0-255</code> in binary,
        and <code>0x00-0xFF</code> in hex.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Since a virtual address is encoded by such a <em>word</em>, the most important system parameter determined by
        the word size is the
        <strong>maximum size of the virtual address space</strong>.
        That is, for a machine with a w-bit sized word, the virtual addresses can range from <code>0</code> to
        <code>(2^w)-1</code>,
        giving the programs access to <em>at most</em> <code>2^w</code> bytes.
