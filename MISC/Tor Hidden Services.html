    <h3>Connecting to a hidden service</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The client (the tor browser) picks three <strong>Tor nodes</strong> to be a <em>guard</em> (entry) node, a
            <em>middle</em> node and an <em>exit</em> node.
        </li>
        <blockquote>Tor has a small set of trusted servers called directory authorities (around 10 hardcoded ones).
            These authorities keep an up-to-date list of all Tor relays (nodes) that can be used by the tor client.
        </blockquote>
        <li>The tor browser exchanges three <strong>keys</strong> with the three nodes.
            <ul>
                <li><em>K3 with the Entry node</em></li>
                <li><em>K2 with the Middle node</em></li>
                <li><em>K1 with the Exit node</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When the browser wants to send out an http request, it encrypts it with K1, then K2, then K3.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Entry node</strong> receives the packet and decrypts the first encryption layer using its K3,
            then it sees that it needs to forward the packet to the <strong>Middle node</strong> (the packet now has the
            source IP address of the Entry node and the destination IP address of the Middle node).</li>
        <li>The Middle node receives the packet and decrypts the second encryption layer using K2, then forwards it to
            the <strong>Exit node</strong>.</li>
        <li>The Exit node receives the packet and decrypts the final encryption layer using K1, then forwards the
            request to the appropriate destination.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Each node only knows the IP address of the device before and after it, so the client is anonymous here.</li>
        <li>When the tor client encrypts the request in three layers, it ensures appropriate addressing for each layer
            (for example, after the first encryption layer is removed, the entry node should know where to forward the
            packet, which should be the IP address of the middle node.</li>
        <li>The three tor nodes used to route the traffic are called a <strong>circuit</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Hidden Services Work</h3>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <ol>
        <li>When a server decides to become a tor <strong>hidden service</strong>, it first uses a tor circuit to
            connect to three random devices and chooses them to become its <strong>Introduction
                Points</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li>The identity of the server is protected here since it's connecting to these devices via a tor
                    circuit, so it looks just like any other client that is using the tor browser.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <img src="images/tor2.png" width="600">
        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <li>The Hidden Service publishes a <strong>Descriptor</strong>, which contains the following:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The <strong>Content</strong> of the descriptor, which would be the IP addresses of the chosen
                    introduction points, its public key for authentication, and some metadata about the server.</li>
                <li>Its <strong>Digital Signature</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, the server uses a <strong>Hashing</strong> algorithm to create a Hash value of the
                            Content.</li>
                        <li>Then it <strong>Encrypts</strong> it using its <strong>Private Key</strong>.</li>
                        <li>This is done to verify the identity of the server.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
              <img src="images/tor3.png" width="800">
        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <li>Users can <strong>authenticate</strong> the descriptor (make sure that in order to connect to
            <code>xyz.onion</code> they need to reach out to the specified introduction points) like this:
            <ul>
                <li>First, they create a <strong>Hash value</strong> of the <strong>Content</strong> using the same
                    algorithm that the server used to create its own hash.</li>
                <li>Then they <strong>Decrypt</strong> the <strong>Digital Signature</strong> using the server's
                    <strong>Public Key</strong> (which is derived from its <code>xyz.onion</code> address) resulting in
                    <em>a</em> (possibly <em>the</em>) hash.
                </li>
                <li>The two resulting hashes should match to verify the server's identity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <li>After the client authenticates the descriptor, it creates another tor circuit consisting of an
            <strong>Entry node</strong>, a <strong>Middle node</strong> and a <strong>Rendezvous Point</strong>. The
            Rendezvous Point is the final node in this circuit, and it will act as the link between the client and the
            server.
        </li>

        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <li>The client generates a <strong>Cookie</strong> <em>(which is a
                randomly generated string used as a "one time
                secret")</em> and sends it over to the rendezvous point (thru the established circuit) along with the IP
            address of a randomly selected
            introduction point fetched from the descriptor.</li>
          <img src="images/tor4.png" width="900">
        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <li>The rendezvous point receives the Cookie, and creates a new tor circuit of an <strong>Entry</strong>,
            <strong>Middle</strong>, and <strong>Exit</strong> nodes to connect to the IP address of the
            <strong>introduction point</strong>. Then, the rendezvous point sends over the Cookie to the introduction
            point, along with its <em>own</em> IP address <em>(the introduction point doesn't know the IP address of the
                rendezvous point since the connection between them happened via a tor circuit).</em>
        </li>

        <img src="images/tor5.png" width="800">
        <div class="divider2"></div>
        <li>The introduction point receives the Cookie and the IP address of the rendezvous point, then sends these over
            to the server <em>(which is the tor service)</em> via the tor circuit that was established in the beginning.
        </li>

        <img src="images/tor6.png" width="800">
        <div class="divider2"></div>
        <li>The server decides if it wants to connect back to the client, if it does, it will create <em>another</em>
            tor circuit (Entry, Middle and Exit nodes) to connect to the rendezvous point <em>(it knows its IP address since
            it received it with the cookie)</em>. Then it sends back that Cookie to the rendezvous point.</li>
        <img src="images/tor7.png" width="900"> 
        <div class="divider2"></div>

        <li>The rendezvous point sees that it received the same Cookie from two devices (the server and the client), so
            it connects them together.</li>
    </ol>
