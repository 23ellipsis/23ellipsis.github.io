    <h1><small>2.11</small> SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol</h1>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <p>
        SNMP "<strong>Simple Network Management Protocol</strong>" is an application-layer protocol for monitoring and
        managing network devices on a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of SNMP is to provide network devices, such as routers, servers and printers, with a common language
        for sharing information with a Network Management System (<strong>NMS</strong>).
    </p>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <span class="note">Network Management Systems</span>
    <blockquote>
        A <strong>Network Management System</strong> (NMS) is a software tool used to monitor, manage, and optimize the
        performance, configuration, and security of computer networks. NMSs provide centralized management by monitoring
        network devices like routers, switches, and servers, and they offer real-time performance data, fault detection,
        and alerting.
        NMSs use protocols like <strong>SNMP</strong> and <strong>NetFlow</strong> to collect data. Popular NMS
        softwares include SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, Nagios, PRTG Network Monitor, Zabbix, and ManageEngine
        OpManager.

    <h2>Main components of SNMP</h2>

    <h3>1. SNMP agent</h3>
    <p>
        The SNMP agent is the networking device (like a router or a switch) that has SNMP enabled.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The SNMP agent has multiple <strong>Objects</strong> that can be interacted with, for example: a router
            might have objects for its <code>name</code>, <code>uptime</code>, <code>interfaces</code> and
            <code>routing table</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Each object is assigned an <strong>Object Identifier</strong> (OID), which is essentially a sequence of
            numbers used to identify that object.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/2.11.2.png" width="400" alt="SNMP OID Example" />
    <ul>
        <li>These OIDs are stored in a file called a <strong>Management Information Base</strong> (MIB).</li>
        <li>The MIB follows a <em>tree structure</em> where each level in the hierarchy represents a more specific
            category, leading down to individual data points (or "managed objects") that describe various aspects of a
            device.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <h3>2. The NMS</h3>
    <p>
        The Network Management System is a software that accepts and processes SNMP messages.
    </p>


    <blockquote>SNMP usually runs over UDP port 161</blockquote>

    <h2>MIBs and OIDs</h2>
    <img src="images/2.11.3.png" width="550" alt="MIB Tree Structure" />
    <p>
        This is an MIB "Management Information Base" where multiple objects are organized into a tree structure. The OID
        (Object ID)
        for the object <code>ip</code> for example is <code>.1.3.6.1.1.1.4</code>
    </p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We have a router which we want to configure such that it becomes an SNMP agent, which will enable it to
            communicate with our NMS.</li>
        <li>Inside the router's console, we do the following: <code>Router(config)# snmp-server</code>, which enables
            the SNMP server on the agent.</li>
        <li>We then set the <strong>community string</strong>, which is similar to a password. If the agent receives a
            command (from the NMS) with the correct community string, the agent will respond to it.</li>
        <li>We can then configure our NMS to use the community string we've set on the agent so that it can send
            <code>GET</code> or <code>SET</code> requests, which will enable us to manage the agent.
        </li>
    </ol>
