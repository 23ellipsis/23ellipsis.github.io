    <p>
        IMAP and POP are two methods to <em>access</em> email. IMAP is the recommended method when you need to check
        your emails from several different devices, such as a phone, laptop, and tablet.
    </p>

    <h3>IMAP</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>IMAP</strong> "Internet Message Access" allows you to access your email wherever you are, from any
        device. When you read an email message using IMAP, you aren't actually downloading or storing it on your
        computer; instead, you're <em>reading</em> it from the email service. As a result, you can check your email from
        different devices, anywhere in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        IMAP only downloads a message when you click on it, and attachments aren't automatically downloaded. This way
        you're able to check your messages a lot more quickly than POP.
    </p>


    <blockquote>IMAP usually runs over port <strong>143</strong> (unencrypted) or <strong>993</strong> (encrypted via
        SSL/TLS).</blockquote>

    <h3>POP</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>POP</strong> works by contacting your email service and <em>downloading</em> all of your new messages
        from it. Once they are downloaded onto your PC or Mac, they are deleted from the email service. This means that
        after the email is downloaded, it can only be accessed using the <strong>same computer</strong>. If you try to
        access your email from a different device, the messages that have been previously downloaded won't be available
        to you.
