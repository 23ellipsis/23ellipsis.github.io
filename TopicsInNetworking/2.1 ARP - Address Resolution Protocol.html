  <h1><small>2.1</small> ARP - Address Resolution Protocol</h1>

  <div class="divider2"></div>

  <p><strong>ARP</strong> "Address Resolution Protocol" is the protocol used to discover the MAC address of a known IP address.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encapsulated within the L2 header which contains the source and destination <strong>MAC addresses</strong>, is the L3 packet which contains the source and destination <strong>IP addresses</strong>.</li>
    <li>When a <code>PC1</code> wants to communicate with <code>PC2</code>, it typically would use <code>PC2</code>'s IP address as a destination, however, it might not know its MAC address. (example scenario: <code>ping [PC2's IP address]</code>)</li>
    <li>If <code>PC1</code> and <code>PC2</code> were inside a LAN, <code>PC1</code> would need to discover <code>PC2</code>'s MAC address, because <em>inside</em> a LAN means separated by a layer 2 device like a switch, which are unable to operate using IP addresses and they need to know the MAC address of the destination.</li>
    <li>This discovery is done using ARP.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="divider1"></div>
  <h4>The ARP process consists of two messages:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>ARP Request</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>It is sent as a broadcast ethernet frame.</li>
        <li>"Who has the IP address of <code>192.168.1.3</code>"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ARP Reply</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>It is sent as a unicast frame to the device that requested it.</li>
        <li>"I have the IP address of <code>192.168.1.3</code>, here's my MAC address …"</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <blockquote>
    When a broadcast message is sent, the destination MAC address would be <code>FFFF.FFFF.FFFF</code></p>

  </blockquote>

  <div class="divider1"></div>
  <p>Note that after a device receives the ARP reply, it keeps the IP address and the corresponding MAC address in its ARP table.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Tip:</em> To view the ARP table, use the command <code>arp -a</code><br>
     “<strong>Dynamic</strong>” means that our device learned the IP and MAC addresses using an ARP request.<br>
    “<strong>Static</strong>” means that the IP and MAC addresses are a default entry on our device.</p>
