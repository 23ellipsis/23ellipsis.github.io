    <h1><small>2.6</small> HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol</h1>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <p>
        <strong>HTTP</strong> <em>"Hypertext Transfer Protocol"</em> is an <strong>application-layer</strong> protocol
        used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as <a href="HTML.html" class="custom-link">HTML</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It was designed for communication between <strong>web browsers</strong> and <strong>web servers</strong>,
            but it can also be used for other purposes like <a href="APIs.html" class="custom-link">API</a>
            communications, <a href="RPC - Remote Procedure Call.html" class="custom-link">RPC - Remote Procedure
                Calls</a> and mail transfer.</li>
        <li>HTTP follows a classical <strong>client-server model</strong> with a client opening a connection to make a
            request, then waiting until it receives a response.</li>
        <li>HTTP is <strong>stateless</strong>, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two
            requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h2>Overview of HTTP</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>HTTP</strong> is a <strong>protocol</strong> for fetching resources such as HTML documents.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A complete document is typically constructed from <strong>resources</strong> such as text content, layout
            instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/2.6.1.png" width="600" alt="HTTP Resources Diagram" />

    <p>
        Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages <em>(as opposed to a stream of data)</em>. The
        messages sent by the <strong>client</strong> are called <strong>requests</strong> and the messages sent by the
        server as an answer are called <strong>responses</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTP is an <strong>application layer</strong> protocol that is implemented over <a
                href="2.2 TCP - Transmission Control Protocol.html" class="custom-link">TCP</a> or over an encrypted TCP
            connection using TLS</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Components of HTTP Based Connections</h3>
    <h4>1. The User-Agent</h4>
    <p>
        HTTP is a <strong>client-server</strong> protocol: <em>requests</em> are sent by one entity, the
        <strong>user-agent</strong>, which is <em>any</em> tool that acts on behalf of the user.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most of the time the user-agent is a <strong>Web browser</strong>, but it can be anything, for example, a
            web crawler for some search engine.</li>
        <li>The browser is <em>always</em> the entity initiating the request; never the server.</li>
        <li>To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the
            page. Then it parses this file, making additional requests corresponding to the other files linked in that
            HTML document, like JavaScript and CSS files.</li>
    </ul>



    <blockquote>This explains why multiple requests are made to view a single web page.</blockquote>


    <h4>2. The Web Server</h4>
    <p>
        The <strong>server</strong> <em>serves</em> the document as requested by the client.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A server appears as only a single machine virtually; but it may actually be a collection of servers sharing
            the load (load balancing), or other software (such as caches, a database server, or e-commerce servers).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Proxies</h4>
    <p>
        Between the Web browser and the server, numerous computers and machines relay the HTTP messages in different
        layers of the OSI stack. Those operating at the application layers are generally called
        <strong>proxies</strong>. These can be transparent, forwarding on the requests they receive without altering
        them in any way, or non-transparent, in which case they will change the request in some way before passing it
        along to the server. Proxies may perform numerous functions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>caching</strong> the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache</li>
        <li><strong>filtering</strong> like an antivirus scan or parental controls</li>
        <li><strong>load balancing</strong> to allow multiple servers to serve different requests</li>
        <li><strong>authentication</strong> to control access to different resources</li>
        <li><strong>logging</strong> allowing the storage of historical information</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider1"></div>


    <h3>HTTP Packets</h3>
    <p>When you load a webpage, your browser first establishes a connection to the
        requested web server via a TCP handshake. If the website operates with HTTPs (the encrypted version of HTTP), a
        <strong>key exchange process</strong>
        happens between you (the client) and the server so that you can exchange encrypted messages.
    </p>
    <p>HTTP requests and responses exist <em>inside</em> the TCP packet, and these requests/responses are constructed in
        <strong>plain text</strong>, meaning,
        unlike TCP and IP headers which contain binary data that could be arbitrary for us humans, HTTP headers contain
        text data.</p>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <h4>HTTP Requests</h4>
    <pre><code>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Connection: keep-alive
</code></pre>
    <p> This is an example of a simple HTTP request. Here's a breakdown of each line:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>GET</code> is the <strong>HTTP Method</strong> used for this connection. It could be
            <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>
            among others. It simply specifies the <strong>action</strong> we want to perform. In this case, it's
            fetching resources.</li>
        <li><code>/index.html</code> is the <strong>resource</strong> we're requesting from the web server. Remember
            that this whole HTTP header is <em>encapsulated</em>
            within more headers (IP header, TCP header ...), so we don't really need to specify the IP address of the
            web server since that information is already present in the IP header. </li>
        <li><code>HTTP/1.1</code> specifies the HTTP version</li>
        <li><code>Host</code>, <code>User-Agent</code>, <code>Accept</code>, <code>Accept-Language</code> and
            <code>Connection</code> are <strong>HTTP headers</strong> and they're used to control how the client and
            server communicate. </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <h4>HTTP Responses</h4>
    <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 25 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.57
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1256
Connection: keep-alive

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;Hello World!&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p> This is an example of a simple HTTP response. Here's a breakdown of each line:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the <strong>HTTP version</strong> used for this connection.
        <li><code>200 OK</code> is the <strong>HTTP Status Code</strong> which is a number sent by the server to tell
            the client what happened with the request. In this case, the request was successful.</li>
        <li><code>Date</code>, <code>Server</code>, <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Length</code> and
            <code>Connection</code> are <strong>HTTP headers</strong> and they're used to control how the client and
            server communicate. </li>
        <li><code>&lt;html&gt;...&lt;html&gt;
</code> is the <strong>response body</strong> which is the actual resource (webpage, file or data) sent by the server.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h2>Evolution of HTTP</h2>
    <h3>HTTP 1.0</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>HTTP 1.0</strong> added functionality for the <em>firstly introduced</em> <strong>HTTP 0.9</strong>.
        This functionality included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>New HTTP methods (HTTP 0.9 only supported <code>GET</code>)</li>
        <li>Some HTTP headers</li>
        <li>Status Codes</li>
        <li>Different file types (HTTP 0.9 only supported HTML files)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With HTTP 0.1, each request needed its own TCP connection, which wasn't really efficient in terms of speed and
        performance.
    </p>
    <img src="images/2.6.3.png" width="400" alt="HTTP 1.0 Diagram" />

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>HTTP 1.1</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>HTTP 1.1</strong> improved performance and added new functionality to <strong>HTTP 1.0</strong>, which
        included:
    </p>

    <h4>Reused connection</h4>
    <p>
        The connection now can be reused to execute several requests within a single TCP connection. This improves
        performance by eliminating the need to establish a new TCP connection for each request.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the <code>Connection: keep-alive</code> header is present, the TCP connection remains open.
    </p>
    <img src="images/2.6.4.png" width="550" alt="HTTP 1.1 Connection Reuse Diagram" />
    <br>


    <blockquote>Note that HTTP 1.1 mostly opened multiple TCP connection (typically 6) in order to send multiple
        requests simultaneously as pipelining was rarely used. This made it slowed and inefficient, and was fixed later
        with Multiplexing in HTTP 2.0</blockquote>


    <h4>Pipelining</h4>
    <p>
        This feature allows your browser to send multiple HTTP requests over the same TCP connection without waiting for
        responses. The responses, however, have to be sent back in order.
    </p>


    <blockquote>Although pipelining improved speed, it wasn't supported by many browsers and servers. It also introduced
        a new issue: <strong>Head Of Line Blocking</strong>, which occurs when one of the responses takes too long to
        get processed, and it delays the responses that come after it.</blockquote>

    <br>
    <h4>Host Header</h4>
    <p>
        The <code>Host</code> header is mandatory in HTTP 1.1, and it allows servers to handle multiple <strong>domain
            names</strong> using <strong>the same IP address</strong> enabling better server resource utilization and
        facilitating the hosting of multiple websites on a single server.
    </p>

    <h4>New HTTP methods</h4>
    <p>
        This version added six new methods: <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, <code>DELETE</code>,
        <code>CONNECT</code>, <code>TRACE</code>, and <code>OPTIONS</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Caching</h4>
    <p>
        Additionally, a bunch of new caching mechanisms were introduced such as the <code>Cache-Control</code> header,
        allowing clients and servers to control caching behavior more effectively.
    </p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>HTTP 2.0</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>HTTP 2.0</strong> added new functionality which includes:
    </p>

    <h4>Multiplexing</h4>
    <p>
        Multiplexing allows the browser to fire off multiple requests at once on the same connection and receive the
        requests back in <em>any</em> order (unlike in HTTP 1.1 where responses needed to be sent back in order).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is done using <strong>streams</strong>. Each stream is identified by a unique <strong>stream ID</strong>
        and is used for a request/response pair.
    </p>

    <h4>Binary Framing</h4>
    <p>
        HTTP/2 uses a binary format instead of a textual format, which makes data smaller and makes reading it <em>-by
            computers-</em> faster.
    </p>

    <blockquote>Although all data is ultimately transmitted as binary over WIFI or Ethernet, "binary format" here is a
        reference to the data in the Application Layer itself, meaning that servers will be receiving and interpreting
        that data directly from the binary format. (for example, HTTP headers will be represented in binary instead of
        plain text).</blockquote>


    <h4>Header Compression</h4>
    <p>
        HTTP/2 uses <strong>HPACK</strong>, a header compression algorithm that reduces the overhead of HTTP headers.
        This decreases the amount of data transmitted, improving speed.
    </p>

    <h4>Server Push</h4>
    <p>
        The server can proactively send resources to the client without waiting for a request. For example, if a client
        requests an HTML page, the server can also send associated CSS and JavaScript files immediately.
    </p>
