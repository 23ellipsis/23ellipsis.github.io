    <h1><small>2.10</small> NFS - Network File System</h1>
    <div class="divider2"></div>


    <p>
        The NFS "<strong>Network File System</strong>" protocol allows remote hosts to mount file systems over a network
        and interact with them as though they are locally mounted.
    </p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>How NFS Works</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Server</strong> is the machine that shares directories and files over the network.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Client</strong> is the machine that mounts these shared directories, allowing access to remote
        files.
    </p>
    <p>
        The client uses the NFS protocol to send requests to the server for file operations such as
        <em>read</em>, <em>write</em>, <em>open</em>, and <em>close</em> on remote files.
    </p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <h4>Mounting</h4>
    <p>
        Mounting is the process where the client attaches a remote filesystem (from the server)
        to a directory on its local system. Once mounted, users and applications can access the remote files
        as if they were local.
    </p>

    <h4>Statelessness</h4>
    <p>
        Traditional NFS versions, such as <strong>NFSv3</strong>, are stateless, meaning the server does not
        maintain any client session information. Each client request includes all necessary information
        to complete the operation.
    </p>

    <h4>RPC (Remote Procedure Call)</h4>
    <p>
        NFS relies on RPC for communication. RPC is a protocol that allows a client to invoke procedures on the server
        over the network as though they were local function calls.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        The idea is that NFS itself doesn’t read or write files directly; it acts as a bridge between the client and the
        server’s local file system. When an application on the client accesses a file on an NFS mount, the NFS client
        converts the request (like READ or WRITE) into an RPC call and sends it over the network, for it to be handled
        by the RPC and NFS services on the server side.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>rpcbind</h3>
    <p><strong>rpcbind</strong> is a service used in UNIX/Linux systems that helps clients find the correct port number
        for RPC-based
        services, like NFS.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Many network services, including NFS in versions before NFSv4, don’t listen on fixed, well-known ports.
            Instead, they can run on random (dynamic) ports assigned at runtime.</li>
        <li>
            Because clients need to know which port number to connect to, there must be a way to discover this port.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>rpcbind</code> service always listens on port <code>111</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            When RPC services like NFS start, they register themselves with the rpcbind service. They tell rpcbind:
            "Here's my program number, I'm listening on port number X".
        </li>
        <li>
            Now when the client wants to connect to an RPC service (for example <code>mountd</code>), it first contacts
            rpcbind on port 111 and asks "which port is this service using" to which rpcbind replies.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>NFS Versions</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>NFS version 3</strong> (NFSv3) supports safe asynchronous writes and is more robust at error handling
        than the previous NFSv2. It also supports 64-bit file sizes and offsets, allowing clients to access more than 2
        GB of file data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NFS version 4</strong> (NFSv4) works through firewalls and over the Internet, no longer requires an
        <code>rpcbind</code> service, supports ACLs, and utilizes stateful operations.
    </p>

    <h2><em>some</em> required services for running an NFS server</h2>
    <p>
        All NFS versions rely on <em>Remote Procedure Calls</em> between clients and servers as discussed earlier. RPC
        services are often
        controlled by the <code>rpcbind</code> service.
    </p>
    <p>
        To share or mount NFS file systems, the following services work together depending on which version of NFS is
        implemented:
    </p>

    <h4>nfs</h4>
    <p>
        <code>systemctl start nfs</code> starts the NFS server and the appropriate RPC processes to service requests for
        shared NFS file systems.
    </p>

    <h4>rpcbind</h4>
    <p>
        <code>rpcbind</code> accepts port reservations from local RPC services. These ports are then made available (or
        advertised) so the corresponding remote RPC services can access them. <code>rpcbind</code> responds to requests
        for RPC services and sets up connections to the requested RPC service. This is not used with NFSv4.
    </p>
