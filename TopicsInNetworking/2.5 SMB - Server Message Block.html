    <h1><small>2.5</small> SMB - Server Message Block</h1>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <p>
        <strong>SMB</strong> stands for "Server Message Block". It is an application layer protocol that is mainly used
        for providing shared access to things like files and printers on the network.
        For instance, whenever you send a print request to the printer that is present inside you LAN, SMB can be used
        to send the print request. It is based on the <strong>request-response model</strong>.
    </p>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <h4>SMB can be:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Run directly over <strong>TCP</strong> port <strong>445</strong>: On Windows SMB can run directly over
            TCP/IP without the need for Netbios, using services like MICROSOFT-DS that allow direct hosting of SMB via
            port 445.</li>
        <li>Run via <strong>NetBIOS API</strong> which in turn can run in several different ways — on
            <strong>UDP</strong> ports <strong>137</strong>, <strong>138</strong> or <strong>TCP</strong> port
            <strong>139</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In a nutshell:<br>
            445 → SMB over TCP/IP<br>
            139 → SMB over Netbios (TCP)<br>
            137/138 → SMB over Netbios (UDP)</p>

    <h3>NetBIOS</h3>

    <p>NetBIOS is an acronym that stands for <strong>Network Basic Input Output System</strong>. It might seem like a
        protocol but <em>isn't</em> one, it is an API that provides <strong>session layer services</strong> that allow
        applications on different computers to communicate over a LAN.
        In modern networks NetBIOS runs over TCP/IP via the <strong>NetBIOS over TCP/IP</strong> or commonly known as
        <strong>NBT</strong> protocol. This results in each computer on the network having a NetBIOS name along with the
        IP Address corresponding to the host name.</p>
    <p><em>netbios is rarely used with SMB today as it can just run directly over TCP port 445</em></p>



    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h4>Netbios can provide three services:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>NetBIOS Name Service (NetBIOS-NS)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Handles name registration and resolution, similar to how DNS operates.
                    Before initiating a session, an application must register its NetBIOS name using this service.</li>
                <li><strong>Ports:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>UDP 137</strong>: Primary port for NetBIOS name service.</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP 137</strong>: Rarely used, but can occasionally be seen for name services.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>NetBIOS Datagram Service (NetBIOS-DGM)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provides connectionless communication for broadcasting messages across the
                    network. Since it's connectionless, applications are responsible for error detection and data
                    recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Port:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>UDP 138</strong>: Used for sending datagram messages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>NetBIOS Session Service (NetBIOS-SSN)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Facilitates connection-oriented communication between devices. Unlike the
                    datagram service, this provides built-in error detection and recovery mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Port:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>TCP 139</strong>: Used to establish and manage NetBIOS sessions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>SMB Versions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SMB1</strong> was the first implementation of SMB. It used 16-bit packet and small data buffers,
            which greatly limited performance, <strong>it did not have any encryption for data in transit
                whatsoever</strong>, which is why it is so insecure. In addition to this, it is highly susceptible to
            MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>SMB2</strong> improved performance by increasing packets to 32-bit and 128-bit for files,
            furthermore unnecessary data that was transmitted when performing operating via SMB was substantially
            reduced. Security was improved to prevent MITM attacks through packet signing <strong>although still no
                built-in encryption support</strong>.</li>
                <br>
        <li><strong>SMB3</strong> added more performance and security enhancements such as multichannel and
            <strong>end-to-end encryption using AES</strong> were introduced in, as well as functionality to enforce
            secure connections with newer clients.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>How does SMB work?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>SMB client request</strong> – Through the SMB protocol, the client device sends a <em>request</em>
            to the <em>SMB server</em>, seeking to access shared resources.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong> – After establishing a <em>session</em> with the server, the client
            transmits its identification credentials to the server. The server then verifies whether the client is
            authorized to access the requested resources.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Resource access</strong> – Upon successful authentication, the client gains the ability to transfer,
            read, and write data to shared files, access shared devices, and execute tasks on them.</li>
            <br>
        <li><strong>Session termination</strong> – When the client has completed its tasks, it can terminate the SMB
            communication, releasing the resources on both the client and server sides.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How SMB Works with NetBIOS</h3>
    <p>
    On its own, NetBIOS doesn’t know about IP addresses or the Internet.
    Instead, it uses NetBIOS names (like <code>MYPC</code>) to identify computers.

    To actually move data across networks, NetBIOS was later made to run over TCP/IP, which is called NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) as discussed earlier.

</p>
<br>
<strong>When SMB was first implemented (on DOS/Windows LANs), it needed a way for computers to:</strong>

<ul>
    <li> Find each other by name (\\MYPC\SharedFolder)
</li>
<li>Establish a session for file sharing
</li>
    <li>Exchange messages</li>
  

</ul>
   
<br>
<strong>NetBIOS handled this by providing three services:</strong>
<ul>
    <li> Name Service (UDP 137) – Computers register and resolve NetBIOS names (like DNS for local networks).</li>
    <li> Datagram Service (UDP 138) – Sends broadcast messages</li>
<li>Session Service (TCP 139) – Handles reliable, connection-based communication (used for SMB traffic).</p></li>
</ul>
