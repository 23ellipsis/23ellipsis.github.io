    <h1>2.7 SSH - Secure Shell</h1>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <p>
        SSH <strong>"Secure Shell"</strong> is a protocol used to securely connect to and manage remote computers over a
        network, typically for command-line access, file transfers, and tunneling. It’s the standard way to log into
        servers and network devices securely.</p>
    <p>Before SSH, protocols like <strong>Telnet</strong> were used for remote logins, but they sent everything in
        plain text, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping. SSH fixes this by using <strong>encryption</strong> and
        <strong>authentication</strong>.</p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h3>How SSH Works</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Connection Establishment</strong>: the client initiates a connection to the server running SSH,
            usually on TCP port 22. (the server would be listening on post 22 for incoming SSH connections).</li>
        <li><strong>Key Exchange</strong>: the client and the server perform a <em>key exchange</em> using algorithms
            like Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared session key. From this point, all traffic is encrypted using a
            symmetric encryption algorithm
            <blockquote>
                The idea is that symmetric encryption uses the same key for both sides encrypting and decrypting the
                messages, while asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption. Symmetric
                encryption is faster, but it introduces the issue of <em>how would the encryption key be exchanged
                    without the security getting compromised</em>
                and this is where key exchange algorithms come into play.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: the server proves its identity using its <em>host key</em>, and the client
            authenticates using a password or a <em>public/private key pair</em> via a <em>challenge-response</em>
            mechanism.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Communication</strong>: once authenticated, the user can run commands on the remote SSH
            server, and all data is encrypted using the exchanged key.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="divider1"></div>
    <h3>OpenSSH</h3>
    <p><strong>OpenSSH</strong> is a remote management tool that gives you access to run commands on another
        machine via SSH.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SSH</strong> is the protocol, <strong>OpenSSH</strong> is an <em>implementation</em> of that
            protocol, and it's the most popular one.</li>
        <li>Almost every Linux distro has the SSH client installed by default. This allows us to connect to remote
            servers but not for remote servers to connect to us.</li>
        <li>The client package is called <strong>openssh-client</strong>.
            <br><em>(it allows us to connect to servers (machines) that are running SSH).</em>
   
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h2>Connecting</h2>
    <pre><code>$ ssh user@host</code></pre>
    <p>// connects to the host (IP address) as the user specified.</p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h2>Fingerprints</h2>
     <p>A <strong>Fingerprint</strong> is a <em>hash</em> of the <em>public key</em> of the SSH server. (hashing it makes it shorter and easier to compare)
     </p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>When you connect to a new SSH server, a <strong>"fingerprint"</strong> prompt will pop up.</li>
    
        <li>This is used to verify the server's identity.
            <br><em>For example, the person who runs that server would send you the fingerprint and you'd compare it to
                the one you got prompted with (to avoid MITM attacks and whatnot).</em>
        </li>
        <li>If you choose to store the fingerprint, the next time you connect to that same SSH server, the "fingerprint" prompt isn't gonna show again. This
            happens because your device fetched the fingerprint and stored it in the <code>known_hosts</code> file
            (found in <code>~/.ssh</code>).</li>
        <li>This is used so that you can get "notified" if it happened and you connected to an impostor <em>(an SSH
                malicious server pretending to be the one you're trying to connect to)</em>. You'll get the fingerprint
            prompt which means that you haven't visited that malicious SSH server before.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider1"></div>

    <h2>Public and Private Keys</h2>
            <p>Public and private key pairs can be used for authentication, which avoids using passwords.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using a key is more secure than a password. So the best security measure would be to disable password logins
            (to avoid brute force attacks) and only allow logins using keys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Process:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The client generates a key pair with the command:
            <pre><code>$ ssh-keygen</code></pre>
            // this command generates a pubic key <code>id_rsa.pub</code> and a private key <code>id_rsa</code> that will be saved
            in the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory. <em>RSA is used by default to generate the keys.</em>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The client sends over their <em>public key</em> to the SSH server owner.</li>
        <li>The server owner adds the public key to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file in their <code>~/.ssh</code>
            directory.</li>
        <li>Now, whenever that authorized client connects, they just need to prove to the server that they have the
            <em>private key</em> that corresponds to the authorized <em>public key</em> by the server. This can be done
            using the command:
            <pre><code>$ ssh -i id_rsa user@server</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
        As discussed earlier, this authentication is done using a challenge-response mechanism. This relies on a core implementation of <em>public key cryptography</em>. 

        The idea is simple: the server generates a random challenge (some data) and asks the client to sign that data using its private key. The server then uses the client's public key 
        (from the <code>authorized_keys</code> file) to verify the signature, proving the client's identity by whether or not they actually own the corresponding private key.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Configuring SSH</h2>
    
        <p>SSH can be configured using a <code>config</code> located inside the <code>~/.ssh</code> directory to simplify our SSH login process.</p>
    

    <p>For example, inside the config file, we'd write the following:</p>
    <pre><code>Host myserver          // we'll use this in the commands
Hostname 10.0.2.5    // the host we wanna connect to
Port 22              // the port we wanna connect to
User root            // the user we wanna connect as</code></pre>
    <p>now, we can simply run:</p>
    <pre><code>$ ssh myserver</code></pre>
    <p>instead of:</p>
    <pre><code>$ ssh root@10.0.2.5</code></pre>
