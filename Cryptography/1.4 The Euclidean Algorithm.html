        Let <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span> be two positive integers where
        <span class="math">a &gt; b</span>, and let <span class="math">r</span> be the remainder when
        <span class="math">a / b</span>. Then:
    </p>

    <p class="math">
        GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, r)
    </p>
    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        Assume we have two numbers <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span>, with
        <span class="math">a</span> being larger. The Euclidean Algorithm states that to find
        <span class="math">GCD(a, b)</span>, we can instead find
        <span class="math">GCD(b, r)</span> where
        <span class="math">r</span> is the remainder of <span class="math">a / b</span>.
        This approach is more efficient when a and b are large.
    </p>

    <div class="divider1"></div>
    <h3>Visualizing the Process</h3>
    <p>
        The Euclidean Algorithm works because the greatest common divisor of
        <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span> cannot be larger than the smaller number
        (<span class="math">b</span>).
    </p>


    <p> For example,
        <span class="math">GCD(90, 30) = 30</span>, because 30 is the largest integer that divides both numbers, and
        it's also the largest possible value that could be considered the GCD under the right conditions (which is
        dividing both 30 and 90). <br>
        When the smaller integer does not perfectly divide the larger one, the GCD must be <strong>less than the smaller
            integer.</strong> For example, <span class="math">GCD(80, 30)</span> <em>must</em> be less than 30, because
        any number
        larger than 30 will not divide 30, so it won't divide <em>both</em> numbers (30 and 80) to be considered a
        common divisor, let alone the greatest common divisor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the Euclidean Algorithm to find <span class="math">GCD(80, 30)</span> reduces the problem as follows:<br>
        <span class="math">
            GCD(80, 30) → GCD(30, 20)
        </span><br>
        What happened is that we removed full multiples of 30 from 80 (two 30's exist inside 80), leaving only the
        remainder (20).
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <p>
        Find <span class="math">GCD(252, 105)</span> using the Euclidean Algorithm:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Divide <span class="math">252</span> by <span class="math">105</span>:
            <br>
            <span class="math">252 = 105 × 2 + 42</span>
            (remainder <span class="math">r = 42</span>).
            <br>
            Now, <span class="math">GCD(252,105) = GCD(105,42)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide <span class="math">105</span> by <span class="math">42</span>:
            <br>
            <span class="math">105 = 42 × 2 + 21</span>
            (remainder <span class="math">r = 21</span>).
            <br>
            Now, <span class="math">GCD(105,42) = GCD(42,21)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide <span class="math">42</span> by <span class="math">21</span>:
            <br>
            <span class="math">42 = 21 × 2 + 0</span>
            (remainder <span class="math">r = 0</span>).
            <br>
            Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero divisor:
            <span class="math">GCD = 21</span>.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Therefore, <span class="math">GCD(252,105) = 21</span>.
