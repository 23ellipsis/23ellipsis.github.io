    <h1><small>1.6</small> The Modular Multiplicative Inverse</h1>
    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <p>
        A non-zero element <span class="math">a</span> belongs to <span class="math">Z<sub>m</sub></span> is called a
        <em>unit</em> or <em>invertible</em> if there exists an element <span class="math">b</span> in <span
            class="math">Z<sub>m</sub></span> such that
        <span class="math">(a &times; b) mod m &#8801; 1</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case, <span class="math">b</span> is called the <strong>multiplicative inverse</strong> of <span
            class="math">a</span>, denoted <span class="math">b = a<sup>-1</sup></span>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Outside of modulo, a is the multiplicative inverse of b if a*b = 1 (the multiplicative inverse of a is always
        1/a).
    </blockquote>
    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <p>
        An element <span class="math">a</span> in <span class="math">Z<sub>m</sub></span> is a unit if and only if <span
            class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">m</span> are relatively prime:<br>
        <span class="math">GCD(a, m) = 1</span>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        This simply means that in order to check whether integer a has a multiplicative inverse in modulo m, we just
        have to check whether a and m are relatively prime.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        If <span class="math">p</span> is a prime, then <span class="math">GCD(a, p) = 1</span> for all <span
            class="math">a &#8712; {1, 2, ..., p - 1}</span>. Thus every non-zero element in <span
            class="math">Z<sub>p</sub></span> is a unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that we only check inverses for numbers from <span class="math">0</span> to <span class="math">m - 1</span>
        because every other number can be reduced modulo <span class="math">m</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding the multiplicative inverse:</h3>
    <p>
        The Extended Euclidean Algorithm provides a systematic way to find the multiplicative inverse <span
            class="math">a<sup>-1</sup></span> of a non-zero element <span class="math">a</span> in <span
            class="math">Z<sub>m</sub></span>.
    </p>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <h4>Example: Find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11</h4>
    <p>This means: find <span class="math">x</span> such that <span class="math">3 &times; x &#8801; 1 (mod 11)</span>
    </p>

    <p>Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Divide <span class="math">11</span> by <span class="math">3</span>:<br>
            <span class="math">11 = 3 &times; 3 + 2</span> (remainder <span class="math">r = 2</span>).<br>
            Now, <span class="math">GCD(11, 3) = GCD(3, 2)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide <span class="math">3</span> by <span class="math">2</span>:<br>
            <span class="math">3 = 2 &times; 1 + 1</span> (remainder <span class="math">r = 1</span>).<br>
            Now, <span class="math">GCD(3, 2) = GCD(2, 1)</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide <span class="math">2</span> by <span class="math">1</span>:<br>
            <span class="math">2 = 1 &times; 2 + 0</span> (remainder <span class="math">r = 0</span>).<br>
            Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is the last non-zero divisor: <span class="math">GCD = 1</span>.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now that we've confirmed that a multiplicative inverse exists for 3 in modulo 11, we can proceed to find it using
        <strong>Back Substitution</strong>, to end up expressing <span class="math">1</span> as a combination of <span
            class="math">3</span> and
        <span class="math">11</span>:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <span class="math">1 = 3 &minus; 2 &times; 1</span> (this is from step 2 of the Euclidean Algorithm with the
            numbers rearranged to solve for 1)
        </li>
        <li>
            Recall from before that <span class="math">2 = 11 &minus; 3 &times; 3</span>, so substitute:<br>
            <span class="math">1 = 3 &minus; (11 &minus; 3 &times; 3) &times; 1 = 3 &minus; 11 + 3 &times; 3</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simplify:<br>
            <span class="math">1 = 3 &times; 4 &minus; 11 &times; 1</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            This means that <span class="math">1</span> can be written as a linear combination of <span
                class="math">3</span> and <span class="math">11</span>, which is <span class="math">1 = 3 &times; 4
                &minus; 11 &times; 1</span>. <br> And thus the multiplicative inverse of <span class="math">3</span>
            modulo <span class="math">11</span> is <span class="math">4</span>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><span class="math">(3 &times; 4) mod 11 = 12 mod 11 = 1</span></p>
    <p>Therefore, <span class="math">3<sup>-1</sup> &#8801; 4 (mod 11)</span>.</p>

    <div class="divider2"></div>
    <h4>Visualizing the process</h4>
    <p>
        The linear combination expresses <span class="math">1</span> as a sum of multiples of
        <span class="math">3</span> and <span class="math">11</span>. Since we’re working
        <span class="math">mod&nbsp;11</span>, any term that’s a multiple of
        <span class="math">11</span> doesn’t matter (for example,
        <span class="math">11 &times; 100</span> is still congruent to
        <span class="math">0</span> <span class="math">(mod&nbsp;11)</span>).
    </p>

    <p>
        That means the <span class="math">11 &times; (1)</span> part vanishes, leaving just
        <span class="math">3 &times; 4</span>. Since
        <span class="math">3 &times; 4 &equiv; 1 (mod&nbsp;11)</span>, this shows that
        <span class="math">4</span> is the multiplicative inverse of
        <span class="math">3</span> modulo <span class="math">11</span>.
