    <div class="divider2"></div>

    <ol>
        <li>A <strong>mathematical algorithm</strong> (being the encryption algorithm) would produce two keys, and they would be a <strong>pair</strong>.
            <ul>
                <li>The two keys are mathematically linked.</li>
                <li>You cannot derive one from the other.</li>
                <li>If data got encrypted by the first key, the second key would be the <em>only</em> key that can decrypt that data.</li>
                <li>One of these keys would be a <strong>public key</strong> and would be shared <em>publicly</em>.</li>
                <li>The other one would be a <strong>private key</strong>, and would be kept <em>private</em>.</li>
                <li>Note that there isn't a functional difference between the public and private key, any could be either.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <br>
        
        <li>Both parties would exchange their <strong>public keys</strong>. This could be done anywhere since the keys are public anyway.</li>
        
        <br>
        
        <li>If <em>Person1</em> with <em>Key1</em> wanted to send data to <em>Person2</em> with <em>Key2</em>, he would <strong>encrypt</strong> the data using <em>Person2's</em> <strong>public key</strong>.</li>
        
        <br>
        
        <li>Now that the data is encrypted with <em>Person2's</em> public key, only his private key can <strong>decrypt</strong> the data.</li>
        
        <br>
        
        <li>And since this model is dependent on the security of the private key, assuming it is kept safe, only <em>Person2</em> will be able to view the data.</li>
    </ol>
